# Unzipper

The purpose of this program is to unzip nested zip folders (like large ROM libararies). The program executes a simple Python script that asks
the user to specify a zip file or a folder, designate a location for the output, and name the new directory. 

Running the script should iteratively unzip files and place their contents into the specified directory. 

The MacOS and Windows Version are labeled appropriately. 

You will probably need to run the program as an admin since it will be flagged as suspicious.
